## My Swift Projects

In order to practice, I choose a theme and combine it with an app idea that I think people would enjoy.

### SleepFoam

This was designed using the theme of ocean.

### Heartea

The theme for this app was love.

### SCP Reader

I decided to create this app because I wanted a simple SCP reader. Similar apps on the App Store are either not updated, or require an account.

### Character Tool

Because I do a lot of creative writing, I thought it would be useful to have a character planner.

### About Me

I enjoy learning about SwiftUI and UIKit. When I'm not teaching myself about iOS development, I enjoy creative writing.
